# N-QUEENS SOLUTION GENERATOR (USING THE CONCEPT OF BACKTRACKING)

  Source Code Developer: ABDUL MOHSIN SIDDIQI


  DESCRIPTION :
  
  N-Queens puzzle is a well-known problem of placing 'N'
  number of Queens on an N*N Board (or more often a
  Chessboard) in such a way that no two queens threaten
  each other. Thus the arrangement ensures that no two
  queens shares the same row, column or diagonal. The
  solution exists for all natural numbers with the
  exceptions for N=2 & N=3. It is obvious that there might
  be many possible solutions for a particular order N.

  ALGORITHM :
  
  The BACKTRACKING way of determining all possible
  solutions to a particular order N implemented here,
  satisfying the above criteria, is primarily featured upon
  the more general depth-first backtracking algorithm developed
  by Edsger Dijkstra.

  IMPLEMENTATION :
  
  The following Source Code generates one of the possible
  solutions for a given Board of order N. The above concept
  of Backtracking is specifically integrated along with some
  optimizations and improvements on its GUI to make it look
  more fancy.
