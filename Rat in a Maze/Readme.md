#Rat in A Maze (Interactive)

This is an Implementation of a maze puzzle commonly known as 'Rat in a Maze'.

A Maze is given as N*N binary matrix of blocks where source block is the upper left most block i.e., maze[0][0] and destination block is lower rightmost block i.e., maze[N-1][N-1]. A rat starts from source and has to reach destination. The rat can move in any of the four directions: backward, forward, upward or downward but not diagonally.

In the maze matrix, 0 means the block is dead end and 1 means the block can be used in the path from source to destination. Note that this is a simple version of the typical Maze problem.
